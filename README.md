# Segmentation Adventure BI dashboard
Customer segmentation based on AdventureWorks dataset

## Objective
Create customer segmentation that shows customer count and their sales revenue for any selected period (up to month) using last 12 month sales revenue as a base of segmentaiton

## Requirements
- Last 12 month sales revenue should be calculated respective to the period of interest or analysis
-- i.e. if I am looking at May 2023 then I expect sales revenue of April 2022 to May 2023 to be considered as last 12 month
- Customers segmentation is set on static sales revenue threshold values
